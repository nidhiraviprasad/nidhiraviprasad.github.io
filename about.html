			<h3 class="one">Who I Am</h3>

			<p>Hello, I'm Nidhi Raviprasad! I am currently studying Computer Science at Cal Poly. </p>
			
			<p> My goal is to create software which will improve the quality of people's lives. Whether that be in terms of physiology, equity, or simply comfort, I want to make people's lives easier and more enjoyable. </p>

			<p>My interests include machine learning and fullstack web app development! I've created multiple projects with ML in Python using the libraries tensorflow, keras, tflearn, scikit, and others. I have also worked with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, Node), as well as other databases and frameworks. </p>

			<p>My journey with programming is far from over and I am very excited to share what I learn! </p>
		
			<h3 class="one">Other Interests</h3>
			
			<p> Dance: I've been learning Bharatanatyam, a form of Indian classical dance, since the age of 7. Recently, I've been getting into other styles of dance, such as folk and hip-hop.  </p>

			<p> Reading: I'm a huge reader across all genres with a preference for fiction. Talk to me about your recent reads or ask me for recommendations anytime!</p>

			<p> Baking: I love to bake in my free time (read: I really enjoy eating desserts). I love to experiment and try out new recipes, and I find that the act of baking myself makes the results a little sweeter. </p>
