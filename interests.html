				<h3 class="four"> Dance</h3>
				<p> I started learning Bharatanatyam, a form of Indian classical dance, in first grade, under Guru Megha Shetty. I have completed five exams (equivalent to a high school diploma) and I'm training to complete my Bachelors degree. I have also learned some hip hop, Bollywood, and Indian folk dancing. During the pandemic I have been participating at virtual dance festivals!</p>

				<h3 class="four"> Leadership</h3>
				<p> I am passionate about being a leader and working in a team. Currently, I am one of the founders of <a class="four" href="org.html">Codepioneers</a>, a nonprofit organization dedicated to teaching programming online for free. I am also an officer for my school's Spanish Honor Society and a staff member for Aletheia, a schoolwide publication allowing students to speak anonymously on seldom-addressed issues. I strive to work with a diverse group of people and help lead others to success. </p>

				<h3 class="four"> Badminton</h3>
				<p> I started playing badminton in middle school. I am on my school's badminton team (although we cannot play now). At the end of my first season on the team, I received the Most Improved Player award and Scholar Athlete award! I hope to play at least one more season as I enjoyed the team environment and collaboration. </p>

				<h3 class="four"> Reading</h3>
				<p> Reading is one of my favorite hobbies! I enjoy reading from many genres: fantasy, sci-fi, thriller/mystery, classics, and contemporary. My recent favorites include The Night Circus and Six of Crows. Let me know if you have any recommendations!</p>

				<h3 class="four"> Arts & Crafts</h3>
				<p> Art has always been a creative outlet for my thoughts. I enjoy painting, making jewelry, origami, and knitting. I also love finding all sorts of new crafts online and trying them out.  </p>

			<div class="bubble">
				<h3 class="four"> Baking</h3>
				<p> I love to bake (well, I mainly enjoy eating the results, but the process is enjoyable as well). I've made many cakes, cupcakes, muffins, and the like, and though these turn out well, I always manage to either underbake or burn cookies.</p>
